# OpenTwitchTools
A set of two applications, a chat application geared for mods, and an automatic moderator application.

## OpenMod
* chat application (like Chatty, but prettier)
* built-in token authentication window
* support for multiple streams
* ability to add keywords to highlight specific message in chat

## OpenBot (WIP) planned features:
* auto-timeout based on set of keywords
* loyalty system (xp, coins, etc)
* support for raffles, surverys, bets, etc

## Running solution
This is built with the [Node Tools for Visual Studio](https://nodejstools.codeplex.com/). This allows you to debug node applications and edit the nsproj files easily. The actual startup exe is atom-shell (now known as [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)). You can inspect the OpenBot and OpenMod nsproj files for the location, and use x32 or x64 if you'd like.
